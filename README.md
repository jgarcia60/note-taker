# note-taker

## Description 

This project designed a note taking app that stores notes on the Heroku server. The goal of this project was to practice API routes using Express.js and some built-in Node packages like "path" and "fs". The application of connecting user inputs to the server can be translated to many other applications. Get, post, and delete routes are all implemented in this project.

## Installation

To install the project files, you can clone the "note-taker" repository which contains the necessary files at https://github.com/jgarcia60/note-taker by clicking the green drop down "Code" and cloning the repo with an SSH key. To run the command line interface app, you will need to run "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js" in the correct directory in your terminal to test out the code in your local host. Then your created team profile html will be generated in the "output" folder.


## Usage 

You may store your own notes in this easy-to-use app, as well as use the code here as a working example of how to connect Get, Post, and Delete Routes with Express.js

To use the note app, go to https://mysterious-hamlet-15640.herokuapp.com/
